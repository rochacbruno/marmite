# Marmite

> Marmite is a fast, minimal static site generator written in Rust that converts Markdown files into HTML websites. It's designed for simplicity and includes features like live reloading, RSS feeds, and a built-in development server.

Marmite is the easiest static site generator optimized for blogs. It doesn't require specific folder structure or complex configuration - the goal is that a blog can be generated simply by running Marmite on a folder with Markdown and media files. Written in Rust, it provides very fast builds with everything included in a single binary.

## Key Features

- **Shortcodes**: Insert dynamic content using simple markers like `<!-- .youtube id=VIDEO_ID -->`, `<!-- .spotify url="album/ID" -->`, or `<!-- .card slug=content-slug -->`
- **Enhanced Tera Functions**: New template functions including `get_data_by_slug()` for content lookup and enhanced `group()` function with sorting and limiting
- **Content Cards**: Display linked previews of any content (posts, pages, tags, authors, series) with automatic data resolution
- **External URL Support**: Card shortcodes automatically detect and handle external URLs with proper targeting
- **Template URL Functions**: All shortcode templates use the `url_for()` function for proper URL generation
- **URL Preview (Dry Run)**: Use `--show-urls` command to preview all site URLs without building, perfect for verification and planning
- **File Mapping**: Copy arbitrary files during site generation with flexible source and destination patterns, supporting single files, directories, and glob patterns
- **Themes**: Complete theme system with remote theme installation and customization
- **Series Support**: Group related content in chronological order with automatic navigation
- **Enhanced Streams**: Filename-based stream detection with configurable display names
