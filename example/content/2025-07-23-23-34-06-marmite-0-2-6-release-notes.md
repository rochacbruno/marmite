We're excited to announce Marmite 0.2.6, a release packed with powerful new features, improvements, and bug fixes. This release introduces themes, series support for grouping related content, enhanced markdown parsing capabilities, and much more.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### --start-theme Command Updated

The `--start-theme` command now requires a theme name parameter:

```bash
# Old (no longer works)
marmite myblog --start-theme

# New (required)
marmite myblog --start-theme mytheme
```

This change allows you to specify a custom name for your theme when initializing a new site.

## üéâ New Features

### Themes Support

Marmite now supports themes! [[Introducing themes in marmite]]

- Use `--theme <name>` CLI option to override the theme from configuration
- Configure themes in `marmite.yaml` with the `theme` field
- Themes can have their own `templates/` and `static/` directories
- Embedded theme templates for quick theme creation
- **NEW**: Use `--set-theme <url>` to download and install remote themes

```yaml
# Enable a theme in your configuration
theme: mytheme
```

### Series Feature

Group related content into series with chronological ordering. Perfect for tutorials, course materials, or any sequential content. [[Organizing Content with Series in Marmite]]

- Define series in content frontmatter
- Automatic series pages with oldest-to-newest ordering
- Series navigation takes precedence over streams
- RSS and JSON feeds for each series

```yaml
# In your content frontmatter
series: python-tutorial

# In marmite.yaml
series:
  python-tutorial:
    display_name: "Python Tutorial"
    description: "Learn Python programming step by step"
```

### Enhanced Streams

Streams are now more powerful with filename-based detection and display names. [Explore the streams guide](/streams-guide.html) and [[filename-based-streams-organize-content-with-file-naming]]

- Automatically detect streams from filenames (e.g., `dev-my-post.md`)
- Configure display names for streams
- Better stream organization and navigation

```yaml
streams:
  dev:
    display_name: "Development"
    description: "Technical development posts"
```

### Configurable Markdown Parser

Take full control over markdown parsing with extensive configuration options. [[Configurable Markdown Parser Options]]

- Enable/disable CommonMark extensions
- Configure rendering options
- Support for alerts, wikilinks, spoilers, and more

```yaml
markdown_parser:
  render:
    unsafe: true
    figure_with_caption: true
  extension:
    alerts: true
    wikilinks_title_before_pipe: true
```

### Automatic Image Download

Marmite can now automatically download banner images from providers. [Learn about image providers](/automatic-image-download.html)

- Configure with `image_provider: picsum`
- Automatically downloads images when URLs are provided
- Caches images locally for better performance

All templates now include proper IndieWeb microformats for better web interoperability. [Read about IndieWeb compliance](/indieweb-compliance.html)

- h-entry, h-card, and other microformats
- Better semantic HTML structure
- Improved compatibility with IndieWeb tools

### Markdown Source Publishing

Publish your markdown source files alongside HTML output. [See the source publishing guide](/markdown-source-publishing.html)

- Enable with `publish_md: true`
- Link to source repository with `source_repository`
- Transparency for readers who want to see the source

### Additional Features

- **Next/Previous Navigation**: Automatic navigation links between posts
