Marmite can be installed using various methods depending on your platform and preferences. Choose the method that works best for you.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Marmite is using our automated install script:

```bash
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system and architecture
- Download the appropriate binary for your system
- Install it to `~/.local/bin` (or a custom directory)
- Verify the installation

### Custom Installation Directory

To install to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh -s -- --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

### Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export MARMITE_BIN_DIR=/custom/path
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```

## Install from PyPI

Marmite is also released on Python Package Index

```bash
pip install marmite

# OR without installation with uv
uvx marmite
```

Check [[Python Installation with pip]]


## Install from Source

If you have Rust installed, you can build Marmite from source:

```bash

# Or install from GitHub
cargo install --git https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite

# Or install using cargo-binstall to get the compiled binary via cargo
cargo binstall marmite
```

   # Or to user directory (no sudo required)
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   mv marmite ~/.local/bin/
   ```

4. Make sure the binary is executable (Linux/macOS):

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get a "command not found" error, make sure the installation directory is in your PATH:

export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Permission denied

- Use the `--bin-dir` option to install to a user-writable directory
- Or run the install command with `sudo` (not recommended)

### SSL/TLS errors

If you encounter SSL errors when downloading:
```bash
# Use wget instead of curl
wget -O- https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```
