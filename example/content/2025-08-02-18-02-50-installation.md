Marmite can be installed using various methods depending on your platform and preferences. Choose the method that works best for you.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Marmite is using our automated install script:

```bash
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system and architecture
- Download the appropriate binary for your system
- Install it to `~/.local/bin` (or a custom directory)
- Verify the installation

### Custom Installation Directory

To install to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh -s -- --bin-dir /usr/local/bin
```

### Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export MARMITE_BIN_DIR=/custom/path
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```

## Install from Source

If you have Rust installed, you can build Marmite from source:

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install marmite

# Or install from GitHub
cargo install --git https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite

# Or install using cargo-binstall to get the compiled binary via cargo
cargo binstall marmite
```

## Manual Installation

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite/releases/latest)

2. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS
   tar -xzf marmite-*.tar.gz
   
   # For Windows
   unzip marmite-*.zip
   ```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   sudo mv marmite /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or to user directory (no sudo required)
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   mv marmite ~/.local/bin/
   ```

4. Make sure the binary is executable (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/marmite
   ```

## Platform-Specific Installation

### brew

```bash
brew install marmite
```

### Linux

#### Arch Linux

yay -S marmite-bin
```

### FreeBSD

```

For other Linux distributions, use the automated install script or download the binary manually from the releases page.

### Windows

1. Download the Windows binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite/releases/latest)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Add the directory containing `marmite.exe` to your PATH

## Docker

Run Marmite using Docker:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/input ghcr.io/rochacbruno/marmite
# OR
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/input ghcr.io/rochacbruno/marmite --serve
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Marmite is working:

```bash
curl -sS https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh -s -- --force
```

### Using cargo
```bash
cargo install --force marmite
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get a "command not found" error, make sure the installation directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Permission denied

If you get permission errors during installation:
- Use the `--bin-dir` option to install to a user-writable directory
- Or run the install command with `sudo` (not recommended)

### SSL/TLS errors

If you encounter SSL errors when downloading:
```bash
# Use wget instead of curl
wget -O- https://marmite.blog/install.sh | sh
```
