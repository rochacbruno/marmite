Marmite now supports **themes**! This powerful new feature allows you to create reusable template and static asset collections that can be easily shared and applied to different sites.

## What are Themes?

A theme in Marmite is a collection of templates and static assets organized in a specific folder structure. Themes allow you to:

- **Separate content from design** - Keep your content in one place while switching between different visual designs
- **Create reusable designs** - Build themes that can be applied to multiple Marmite sites
- **Share themes with others** - Package and distribute themes for the community
- **Rapid prototyping** - Quickly test different looks for your site

## Theme Structure

A theme consists of:

```
mytheme/
├── templates/          # HTML templates
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── content.html
│   ├── list.html
│   └── group.html
├── static/             # CSS, JS, images, fonts
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── theme.json          # Theme metadata
└── theme.md           # Theme documentation
```

## Creating a New Theme

To create a new theme, use the `--start-theme` command:

```bash
marmite /path/to/site --start-theme mytheme
```

This creates a clean, minimal theme from the embedded theme template with:
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support with automatic system preference detection
- Clean typography using system fonts
- Search functionality (when enabled)
- SEO optimization with OpenGraph meta tags
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Font files (Atkinson Hyperlegible for accessibility)
- Essential assets (favicon, logo, robots.txt)

## Installing Themes

### Download Remote Themes (New in 0.2.6+)

You can now download themes directly from remote repositories:

```bash
# From GitHub
marmite /path/to/site --set-theme https://github.com/username/themename

# From GitLab
marmite /path/to/site --set-theme https://gitlab.com/username/themename

# From Codeberg
marmite /path/to/site --set-theme https://codeberg.org/username/themename

# From direct zip URL
marmite /path/to/site --set-theme https://example.com/themes/mytheme.zip
```

The `--set-theme` command will:
1. Download the theme from the repository
2. Validate that it includes a `theme.json` file
3. Install it to your project
4. Update your `marmite.yaml` to use the new theme

### Set Local Theme

You can also set a theme that already exists in your project:

```bash
marmite /path/to/site --set-theme mytheme
```

## Using a Theme

There are two ways to specify which theme to use:

### 1. Configuration File

Add the theme to your `marmite.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
theme: mytheme
```

### 2. CLI Option

Use the `--theme` option to override the configuration:

```bash
marmite /path/to/site /path/to/output --theme mytheme
```

This CLI option is useful for:
- **Testing themes** without modifying configuration
- **Building with different themes** for different environments
- **Overriding** the theme specified in configuration
- **Automated builds** with different themes

When a theme is set (either via config or CLI), Marmite will:
- Look for templates in `mytheme/templates/` instead of `templates/`
- Copy static files from `mytheme/static/` instead of `static/`
- Fall back to embedded templates if theme files are missing

> **Note**: The CLI `--theme` option takes precedence over the configuration file setting.

## Default Behavior

If no theme is specified (or `theme: null`), Marmite works as before:
- Templates are loaded from `templates/`
- Static files are copied from `static/`
- This maintains backward compatibility with existing sites

## Embedded Theme Template

Marmite now includes an embedded theme template that provides a complete, production-ready starting point. The generated theme includes comprehensive templates with extensive documentation:

### base.html
The main layout template with:
- HTML5 semantic structure
- SEO meta tags and OpenGraph
- Responsive viewport settings
- Dark mode support
- Clean, minimal design

### content.html
Individual post/page template with:
- Article structure
- Author and date information
- Tags and categorization
- Related content sections
- Previous/next navigation

### list.html
Index and listing pages with:
- Post excerpts
- Pagination support
- Author profiles
- Responsive grid layout

### group.html
Category/tag/archive listings with:
- Group overviews
- Content previews
- Hierarchical organization

## Theme Assets

### CSS (style.css)
- Modern CSS with custom properties (CSS variables)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support with automatic system preference detection
- Clean typography using system fonts for fast loading
- Minimal dependencies - no external CSS frameworks required

### JavaScript (script.js)
- Search overlay functionality
- Smooth scrolling for anchor links
- External link indicators
- Mobile-friendly interactions
- Minimal and performant

### Additional Assets
- **Atkinson-Hyperlegible-Regular-102.woff**: Accessible web font
- **avatar-placeholder.png**: Default avatar for authors
- **favicon.ico**: Site favicon
- **logo.png**: Default site logo
- **search.js**: Search functionality (from Marmite core)
- **robots.txt**: SEO robots file

## Customizing Themes

Themes are designed to be customizable:

1. **Colors**: Edit CSS custom properties in `static/style.css`
2. **Layout**: Modify templates in `templates/`
3. **Content**: Use Markdown fragments like `_header.md`, `_footer.md`
4. **Assets**: Add custom images, fonts, etc. to `static/`

## Benefits

### For Site Owners
- **Easy customization** - Change your site's entire look with one config change
- **Professional designs** - Start with clean, well-designed embedded templates
- **Maintainable** - Keep content separate from design
- **Future-proof** - Themes can be updated independently
- **No external dependencies** - Everything needed is embedded in Marmite

### For Theme Creators
- **Reusable** - One theme can be used by multiple sites
- **Documented** - Built-in documentation and metadata (theme.json, theme.md)
- **Flexible** - Support for various content types and layouts
- **Shareable** - Easy to package and distribute
- **Complete template** - Start from a production-ready base

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the clean theme** - Use `--start-theme` to get a solid foundation
2. **Document your changes** - Update `theme.md` with customization notes
3. **Use semantic HTML** - Follow accessibility best practices
4. **Test responsively** - Ensure themes work on all device sizes
5. **Keep it simple** - Avoid unnecessary complexity

## Backward Compatibility

This feature is fully backward compatible:
- Existing sites continue to work without changes
- No theme specified = uses `templates/` and `static/` as before
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

## Example Usage

```bash
# Create a new site
marmite /path/to/my-blog --init-site

# Create a custom theme
marmite /path/to/my-blog --start-theme mybrand

# Option 1: Set theme in configuration
echo "theme: mybrand" >> /path/to/my-blog/marmite.yaml
marmite /path/to/my-blog ./output

# Option 2: Use CLI to override theme (useful for testing)
marmite /path/to/my-blog ./output --theme mybrand

# Option 3: Test different themes without changing config
marmite /path/to/my-blog ./output-clean --theme clean
marmite /path/to/my-blog ./output-dark --theme dark-mode

# Customize the theme
editor /path/to/my-blog/mybrand/static/style.css
```

## Technical Implementation

### Embedded Theme Template

As of version 0.2.6+, Marmite includes an **embedded theme template** that is compiled directly into the binary. This means:

- **No external dependencies** - The theme template is always available
- **Consistent experience** - Same starting template across all installations  
- **Faster theme creation** - No need to locate template files on disk
- **Version compatibility** - Template matches the Marmite version exactly

When you run `--start-theme`, Marmite extracts the embedded theme template files and writes them to your chosen theme directory.

### Theme Loading Priority

1. **Custom theme files** (if theme is specified in config)
2. **Embedded default templates** (fallback)
3. **Local templates/** directory (legacy, when no theme specified)

## Future Enhancements

This is just the beginning! Future theme features may include:
- Theme gallery and package manager
- Theme inheritance and composition
- Advanced theme configuration options
- Community theme sharing platform
- Theme versioning and updates

Themes make Marmite even more powerful and flexible. Whether you're a content creator who wants beautiful designs or a designer who wants to create reusable themes, this feature opens up exciting new possibilities.
