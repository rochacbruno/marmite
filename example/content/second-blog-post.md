Very simple post with media on this website


## this is an external image

## This is a local image

This image is saved on a folder named `media` relative to the content folder.

## This an embedded video

for now, plain html is used to embed, just copy and paste the `iframe` tag here.  
maybe in future we add some shortcode?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjrBTcnnK6c?si=PmQWsGiTh5XguSpb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
