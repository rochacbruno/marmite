# Shortcode Test

This is a test to verify that shortcodes work correctly in subsites and only show subsite-specific content.

## Tags in this subsite

<!-- .tags -->

## Authors in this subsite

<!-- .authors -->

## Recent posts in this subsite

<!-- .posts items=2 -->

These shortcodes should only show content from this subsite (site1), not from the main site.

## Card 

<!-- .card slug=welcome-to-site1 -->

## Card for author

<!-- .card slug=author-site1-admin -->

## Card for tag

<!-- .card slug=tag-subsite -->

## Gallery

<!-- .gallery path=summer2025 -->

## Table of Contents

<!-- .toc -->
