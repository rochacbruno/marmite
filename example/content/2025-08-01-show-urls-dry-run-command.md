# Show URLs Dry Run Command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **Beta** feature currently available only on the main branch. It has not been released in a stable version yet.

The `--show-urls` command allows you to preview all URLs that will be generated by Marmite without actually building the site. This serves as a dry run to understand your site structure and verify URL patterns before generation.

## What is --show-urls?

The `--show-urls` command is a non-destructive way to:
- Preview your site's URL structure
- Verify slug generation for all content
- Check how your content will be organized
- Plan your site navigation
- Debug URL-related issues
- Create external sitemaps or documentation

## Basic Usage

Run the command pointing to your input folder:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls
```

This will display a comprehensive list of all URLs organized by content type.

## Output Format

The command outputs a comprehensive JSON structure containing all URLs organized by content type:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    "/getting-started.html",
    "/why-to-use-marmite.html",
    "/tutorial-python-tutorial-part-1.html"
  ],
  "pages": [
    "/about.html",
    "/contributors.html",
    "/pages.html"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "/tag-tutorial.html",
    "/tag-docs.html",
    "/tags.html"
  ],
  "authors": [
    "/author-rochacbruno.html",
    "/author-marmite.html",
    "/authors.html"
  ],
  "series": [
    "/series-python-tutorial.html",
    "/series.html"
  ],
  "streams": [
    "/index.html",
    "/tutorial.html",
    "/streams.html"
  ],
  "archives": [
    "/archive-2025.html",
    "/archive-2024.html",
    "/archive.html"
  ],
  "feeds": [
    "/index.rss",
    "/tutorial.rss",
    "/index.json",
    "/tutorial.json"
  ],
  "pagination": [
    "/index-1.html",
    "/index-2.html",
    "/tag-docs-1.html"
  ],
  "file_mappings": [
    "/favicon.ico",
    "/robots.txt"
  ],
  "misc": [
    "/index.html"
  ],
  "summary": {
    "posts": 33,
    "pages": 5,
    "tags": 43,
    "authors": 5,
    "series": 2,
    "streams": 3,
    "archives": 4,
    "feeds": 106,
    "pagination": 64,
    "file_mappings": 2,
    "misc": 1,
    "total": 268,
    "meta": {
      "url": "",
      "absolute_urls": false
    }
  }
}
```

## With Base URL

When you have a base URL configured in your `marmite.yaml` or use the `--url` flag:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --url "https://myblog.com"
```

The output will show absolute URLs and the metadata will reflect this:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    "https://myblog.com/getting-started.html",
    "https://myblog.com/why-to-use-marmite.html"
  ],
  "summary": {
    "meta": {
      "url": "https://myblog.com",
      "absolute_urls": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Understanding the Output

### JSON Structure

The output is organized into categories with each containing an array of URLs:

1. **posts**: Individual blog posts with dates
2. **pages**: Static pages without dates  
3. **tags**: Tag archive pages and the tags index page
4. **authors**: Author pages and the authors index page
5. **series**: Series pages and the series index page
6. **streams**: Content streams and the streams index page
7. **archives**: Yearly archive pages and the archives index page
8. **feeds**: All RSS and JSON feed URLs
9. **pagination**: Pagination pages (e.g., `/index-2.html`, `/tag-docs-1.html`)
10. **file_mappings**: Mapped files (e.g., `/favicon.ico`, `/robots.txt`)
11. **misc**: Other generated files

### Summary Section

The `summary` object provides:
- **Counts**: Number of items in each category
- **total**: Total number of URLs generated  
- **meta**: Contains the base URL and whether absolute URLs are used

```json
"summary": {
  "posts": 33,
  "total": 268,
  "meta": {
    "url": "https://myblog.com",
    "absolute_urls": true
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-deployment Verification

Before deploying your site, use `--show-urls` to verify all content will be accessible:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | grep "404"
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | wc -l  # Count total URLs
```

### 2. Processing URLs with JSON

Extract specific URL types using JSON tools like `jq`:

```console
# Get all post URLs
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | jq -r '.posts[]'

# Get total count
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | jq '.summary.total'

# Get feed URLs only  
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | jq -r '.feeds[]'

# Export to other formats
$ marmite myblog --show-urls > site-urls.json
```

### 3. Debugging Slug Generation

Check how your content titles are converted to URL slugs:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | jq -r '.posts[]' | grep "my-complex-title"
```

### 4. Planning Site Navigation

Use the output to plan your site's navigation structure by seeing all available pages and their URLs.

### 5. CI/CD Integration

Include `--show-urls` in your CI pipeline to verify expected URLs are generated:

```yaml
- name: Verify site structure
  run: |
    marmite content --show-urls > urls.json
    # Check if specific URLs exist
    jq -e '.posts[] | select(. == "/getting-started.html")' urls.json
    # Verify minimum URL count  
    [ $(jq '.summary.total' urls.json) -ge 50 ] || exit 1
```

## Combining with Other Options

The `--show-urls` command respects configuration overrides:

```console
# Check URLs with different pagination
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --pagination 5

# Check URLs with a specific theme
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --theme mytheme

# Check URLs with search enabled
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --enable-search true
```

## Notes

- The command only reads your content files; it doesn't write anything to disk
- Draft posts are excluded from the output (except in the draft stream)
- The command uses the same URL generation logic as the actual site builder
- URLs are generated using the `url_for` Tera function internally
- File mappings are included in the `file_mappings` array
- The output is formatted as JSON for easy parsing and integration
- Use tools like `jq` to extract specific data from the JSON output

## Comparison with Site Generation

Unlike `marmite myblog output/` which generates the complete site:
- `--show-urls` only reads and analyzes content
- No HTML files are generated
- No templates are rendered
- No static files are copied
- No file system writes occur

This makes it perfect for quick checks and automation without the overhead of full site generation.

The `--show-urls` command is an essential tool for understanding and verifying your site structure before committing to a full build.
