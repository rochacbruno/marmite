# Show URLs Dry Run Command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **Beta** feature currently available only on the main branch. It has not been released in a stable version yet.

The `--show-urls` command allows you to preview all URLs that will be generated by Marmite without actually building the site. This serves as a dry run to understand your site structure and verify URL patterns before generation.

## What is --show-urls?

The `--show-urls` command is a non-destructive way to:
- Preview your site's URL structure
- Verify slug generation for all content
- Check how your content will be organized
- Plan your site navigation
- Debug URL-related issues
- Create external sitemaps or documentation

## Basic Usage

Run the command pointing to your input folder:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls
```

This will display a comprehensive list of all URLs organized by content type.

## Output Format

The command provides a well-structured output showing:

```
Site URLs organized by content type:

Total content URLs: 86

```

## With Base URL

When you have a base URL configured in your `marmite.yaml` or use the `--url` flag:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --url "https://myblog.com"
```

The output will show absolute URLs:

```

  Getting Started - https://myblog.com/getting-started.html
  Why to use Marmite? - https://myblog.com/why-to-use-marmite.html
  ...
```

## Understanding the Output

### Content Types

The command shows URLs for all content types:

1. **Posts**: Individual blog posts with dates
2. **Pages**: Static pages without dates
3. **Tags**: Tag archive pages listing posts by tag
4. **Authors**: Author pages listing posts by author
5. **Series**: Ordered collections of related posts
6. **Streams**: Content streams (like categories)
7. **Archive**: Yearly archive pages
8. **RSS/JSON Feeds**: Feed URLs for subscriptions

### Post Counts

For grouped content (tags, authors, series, etc.), the output shows the number of posts in parentheses:

```
tutorial (8 posts) - /tag-tutorial.html
```

### Special Pages

The command also includes special index pages:
- `[Tags Index]` - The main tags listing page
- `[Authors Index]` - The main authors listing page
- `[Series Index]` - The main series listing page
- `[Streams Index]` - The main streams listing page
- `[Archive Index]` - The main archive listing page

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-deployment Verification

Before deploying your site, use `--show-urls` to verify all content will be accessible:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | grep "404"
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | wc -l  # Count total URLs
```

### 2. Creating External Sitemaps

Export the URL list for creating sitemaps or documentation:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls > site-urls.txt
```

### 3. Debugging Slug Generation

Check how your content titles are converted to URL slugs:

```console
$ marmite myblog --show-urls | grep "My Complex Title!"
  My Complex Title! - /my-complex-title.html
```

### 4. Planning Site Navigation

Use the output to plan your site's navigation structure by seeing all available pages and their URLs.

### 5. CI/CD Integration

Include `--show-urls` in your CI pipeline to verify expected URLs are generated:

```yaml
- name: Verify site structure
  run: |
    marmite content --show-urls > urls.txt
    grep -q "getting-started.html" urls.txt || exit 1
```

## Combining with Other Options

The `--show-urls` command respects configuration overrides:

```console
# Check URLs with different pagination
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --pagination 5

# Check URLs with a specific theme
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --theme mytheme

# Check URLs with search enabled
$ marmite myblog --show-urls --enable-search true
```

## Notes

- The command only reads your content files; it doesn't write anything to disk
- Draft posts are excluded from the output (except in the draft stream)
- The command uses the same URL generation logic as the actual site builder
- URLs are generated using the `url_for` Tera function internally
- File mappings and static files are not included in the output

## Comparison with Site Generation

Unlike `marmite myblog output/` which generates the complete site:
- `--show-urls` only reads and analyzes content
- No HTML files are generated
- No templates are rendered
- No static files are copied
- No file system writes occur

This makes it perfect for quick checks and automation without the overhead of full site generation.

The `--show-urls` command is an essential tool for understanding and verifying your site structure before committing to a full build.
