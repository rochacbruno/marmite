## How to Contribute

Things to know prior to submitting code:

- All code submissions are done through pull requests against the `develop` branch.
- Take care to make sure no merge commits are in the submission, and use git rebase vs git merge for this reason.

- **Improving the code**
- **Reporting bugs**
- **Suggesting new features**
- **Improving documentation**

When contributing code, it’s always a good idea to open an issue first to discuss the changes you'd like to make. It helps maintainers and other contributors align and provide feedback early. Access [Good first issue](https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which are easy problems to solve for anyone who wants to start collaborating with the project.
